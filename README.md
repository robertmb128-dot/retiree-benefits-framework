# Retiree Benefits Framework
*A Secure-by-Design Reference Architecture for Public-Sector Eligibility Systems*

## Overview
The **Retiree Benefits Framework** is a sanitized, enterprise-grade reference model demonstrating how public-sector eligibility systems can be designed with security, governance, and operational resilience from inception.

This repository showcases:
- Zero Trust architectural principles  
- NIST-aligned security documentation (SSP, PIA, IRP, ConMon)  
- Continuous monitoring and incident response workflows  
- Synthetic data validation pipelines  
- GitHub-based DevSecOps automation  
- Structured governance and change management artifacts  

> **Note:** All data and examples are fully synthetic. No real retiree information is used.
